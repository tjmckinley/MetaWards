`1.5.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/1.4.1...1.5.0>`__ - February 9th 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added :func:`~metawards.mixers.merge_matrix_single_population` and
  :func:`~metawards.mixers.merge_matrix_multi_population` to account
  for different normalisation factors when merging FOIs calculated
  across multiple demographics. This is
  :doc:`described in the tutorial here <tutorial/part05/04_contacts>`.
  It allows the population dynamics to be better modelled, e.g.
  either as all demographics being part of the same population
  with equal contact probabilities, or the demographics having
  different contact probabilities, e.g. as in traditional
  age-based demographics.
* Added :func:`~metawards.mixers.mix_evenly_single_population`
  and :func:`~metawards.mixers.mix_none_single_population` as
  convenience mixers for the case where all demographics are
  part of the same population.
* Added :func:`~metawards.mixers.mix_evenly_multi_population`
  and :func:`~metawards.mixers.mix_none_multi_population` as
  convenience mixers for the case where the contacts between
  demographics depend on the number of individuals in each
  demographic.
* Fixed a small bug where MetaWards raised an exception
  in multi-demographic runs when a custom disease model
  doesn't have a `I` or `R` stage.

`1.4.1 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1>`__ - November 18th 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed a small bug in `output_core` where the Workspace of a demographic
  subnetwork (its subspace) was being zeroed incorrectly after statistics
  had been accumulated and processed, when the code was run on more than
  4 processors. This prevented extractors from getting this data for
  demographics. Simple fix :-). Bug does not impact any previous runs
  or would have been likely to have caused any issues.
* Added Python 3.9 to the GitHub Actions build matrix, and tested that
  the Python 3.9 packages are built and run correctly.
* Bumped Sphinx up to the latest version.


`1.4.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/1.3.0...1.4.0>`__ - August 14th 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MetaWards now includes ward-local parameters (e.g. cutoff and scale_uv), plus
  supports custom user ward-local parameters. This supports modelling of
  different ward-local behaviour, e.g. local control measures or
  local lockdowns. Examples of a local lockdown model is
  in :doc:`chapter 7 <tutorial/part03/07_cutoff>` and
  :doc:`chapter 8 <tutorial/part03/08_local_lockdown>` of
  :doc:`part 3 <tutorial/index_part03>` of the tutorial, plus
  :doc:`chapter 5 of part 8 <tutorial/part08/05_local_network>`.
  This can also be used to model
  :doc:`ward-local vaccination strategies <tutorial/part09/02_vaccinate>`.
* We have re-worked the go_functions. We have added
  :func:`~metawards.movers.go_ward` that can be used with
  :class:`~metawards.movers.MoveGenerator` to specify moves between
  any and all combinations of demographics, disease stages and wards
  (for players) and ward links (for workers). Individuals can move
  from worker to player, player to worker, move around the network,
  move to different networks in different demographics, move
  between different disease stages, move from susceptible to
  infected or infected to susceptible etc. etc. This enables
  some advanced modelling, e.g. of vaccinated or recovered individuals
  who gradually lose immunity and become susceptible again, movements
  associated with, e.g. start of university, and movements and
  quarantine associated with holidays.
* Added a :meth:`Ward.bg_foi <metawards.Ward.bg_foi>` per-ward
  parameter to set a background force of infection that can be used
  to drive (or suppress) infections regardless of the number of
  infecteds in each ward.
* Added a global :meth:`Parameters.bg_foi <metawards.Parameters.bg_foi>`
  to set a per-network background force of infection. This is
  useful as a way to model
  :doc:`holiday destinations as different networks <tutorial/part09/05_holidays>`.
* Added a global :meth:`Parameters.scale_uv <metawards.Parameters.scale_uv`
  make it easier to set and control the scale_uv parameter via
  a design file, parameter or via an adjustment in a demographic.
* Finalised demographic adjustment support, enabling you to create
  demographics with adjusted parameters, e.g. see the
  :doc:`holiday destinations example <tutorial/part09/05_holidays>`.
* Added :class:`~metawards.movers.MoveRecord` that can be used to
  record all moves performed by a mover or go_function. Added
  :func:`~metawards.go_record` that can move specific individuals
  according to specific moves indicated in the
  :class:`~metawards.movers.MoveRecord`. As there is a
  :func:`MoveRecord.invert <metawards.movers.MoveRecord.invert>` you can
  use this to reverse moves.
* Added :meth:`is_infected <metawards.Disease.is_infected>` parameter
  to :class:`~metawards.Disease` to mark whether a disease stage is classed
  as being an infected stage. This is useful for non-recovered,
  non-susceptible and non-infected stages, e.g. vaccinated (V) stages.
  For example see :doc:`this tutorial <tutorial/part09/02_vaccinate>`.
* MetaWards now has a `proper R package <https://github.com/metawards/rpkg>`_.
  You can now install and update
  MetaWards directly from within R. See the updated
  :doc:`installation instructions <install>` and the
  :doc:`R quickstart guide <quickstart/01_R>`.
* Added a ``--UV-max`` command line parameter so that you can specify
  the date in the year when disease transmission is highest (if UV is not
  equal to 1.0, and thus disease transmission is seasonal). This defaults
  to the first day of the outbreak.
* Optimised :func:`~metawards.iterators.advance_foi` to skip calculations
  of FOI for a stage if beta[stage] is zero. This changes the order
  of random numbers, so meaning that this version of metawards will
  give different output than older versions for the same input and
  same random number seed. We've made a similar change to the original
  C code to make sure that this has not invalidated the results.
* Added a "null" or "scratch" ward that can be used to temporarily
  store individuals during a day. This is useful when implementing more
  complex moves that involve gathering and scattering populations.
* Removed all parameters and dead code that were ported from the original
  C code but are unused.

`1.3.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/1.2.0...1.3.0>`__ - July 22nd 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added a new :doc:`quick start guide <quickstart/index>` that quickly
  showcases the main features of MetaWards. A Python, R and command line
  version is available, so this should suit a range of audiences.
* Added support for different demographics to use different networks.
  This is described partially in the :doc:`tutorial/index_part08`,
  but mostly in the new :doc:`quick start guide <quickstart/index>`.
  This will be documented further in the tutorial in a future release
  (e.g. 1.3.1 or 1.4.0).
* Added a :func:`metawards.run` function to run MetaWards jobs from the API.
  This enables jobs to be run from within Python or R scripts, or to run
  interactively from within, e.g. RStudio or Jupyter.
* Added in R support via reticulate. You can now use the MetaWards API
  within R, plus, via the new :func:`metawards.run` function you can
  write nice tutorials or vignettes that include running the jobs.
  Aim to create a CRAN MetaWards package in a future release.
* Cleaned up the Python API so that this is as flexible as the R API.
  Made sure that key classes, like :class:`~metawards.Disease`,
  :class:`~metawards.InputFiles` and :class:`~metawards.Demographics`
  are easy to use and can serialised to/from JSON.
* New :class:`~metawards.Ward` / :class:`~metawards.Wards` API to let
  you easily create new networks in Python or R.
  You can convert :class:`~metawards.Network` to and from a
  :class:`~metawards.Wards`, and these can be saved and loaded from JSON.
  You can harmonise multiple Wards objects, which enables different
  demographics to use different networks. Also can now refer to wards
  in a network by name rather than index.
* Fixed issues with the "single" ward model. This did not assign any
  player weights, so outbreaks were incorrect. This is now fixed, and the
  single-ward model now matches a manually-created single ward model.
* Added convenience executables (metawards-python, metawards-jupyter
  and metawards-reticulate) to make it easier for users to use the
  right Python executable if many are installed on the system.
* Cleaned up the output and changed "UV" to "scale_uv" as this clashed with
  the UV command-line parameter (and confused people).
* Fixed a bug where the "population" parameter was ignored for repeated
  single-ward network runs.
* More robust reading of the traditional network file format
* Added progress bars for slow operations :-)
* Better support for sequential naming of output directories for repeated runs
* "master" branch was renamed to "main"

`1.2.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/1.1.0...1.2.0>`__ - June 26th 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the ability to use custom-named disease stages. You can now run any
  type of model, and are not limited to ``S``, ``E``, ``I`` and ``R``.
  Learn more in the :doc:`tutorial here <tutorial/part07/05_named_stages>`.
* Improved formatting out information output to the user regarding different
  disease stages. This includes better console output and also more
  informative output data files. Again, this is all detailed in the
  above tutorial.
* Updated all output files to support the summary data for custom
  named disease stages. Now you can collect the data you want directly
  without needing to build a custom extractor - just say which mapping
  stage you want. Again, this is described in the above tutorial.
* Added really flexible support for reading in different formats of
  additional seeds. See the :doc:`tutorial here <tutorial/part08/01_networks>`
  and the new :doc:`fileformats documentation <fileformats/index>`.
  This includes being able to read extra seeds from the command line,
  rather than needing to always write a file.
* Added in the ability to seed infections by date as well as day. Also
  seeding wards by name as well as index (e.g. ``Clifton/Bristol``).
* Added in :class:`metawards.Interpret` to consolidate all of the code
  used to interpret strings into data types. This increases the power
  and flexibility of the data parsers, and adds in new features such
  as reading in random data, or adding math functions to the
  expression support, e.g. ``pi * sqrt(3.5)`` now works.
* Added cython support for plugins. If your plugin ends with ``.pyx`` and
  you have cython installed, then it will be compiled at run time.
  This should enable you to write plugin that are both powerful and fast.
* Fixed a deadlock on Linux when using multiprocessing and OpenMP together
* Removed the unused ``.err`` file.
* Removed ``TotalInfections.dat.bz2`` file (and similar) as these were
  difficult to work with and not well understood. Replaced with
  ``total_infections.csv.bz2`` (and similar) files, which have more
  information and are easier to work with (e.g. have column names).

`1.1.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0>`__ - June 11th 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Different demographics can now follow different disease pathways. This
  supports modelling of super-spreaders and hospitals, as described
  in :doc:`part 7 of the tutorial <tutorial/index_part07>`.
* Variables in demographic sub-networks can be scanned independently from
  the overal network or other sub-networks. This means you can, e.g.
  enact lock-downs in specific demographics, or scan disease parameters
  for different demographics.
* Added a :meth:`~metawards.movers.go_stage` function that moves individuals
  from and to specific disease stages in different demographics. This is
  used to support conditional branching, e.g. 20% of I2 infecteds go to
  hospital.
* Added "--star-as-E", "--star-as-R" and "--disable-star" command line
  arguments to control how the "*" state is counted in the summary outputs.
  This enables it to be counted as an extra "E" state, which makes the
  output more meaningful and more easily interpretable.
* Clarified the meaning the "day 0" and "day 1". Now "day 0" is before
  the model run starts (i.e. setup). The first iteration of the model
  run is "day 1". This is a change from previous versions, which called
  the first half of the first iteration "day 0" and the second half "day 1".
  Since seeding happens in the first half, this means that we now seed one
  day earlier than previous versions, so outbreaks are now one day ahead.
* Fixed a major bug in calculation of the demographic sub-networks
  denominators. These have not been used in production yet. If you
  are going to use demographic sub-networks then please make sure
  you use this version (1.1.0) or above.
* Added database support to :class:`~metawards.OutputFiles`, so that you
  can now write data to SQLite3 databases. This is described in a new
  part of :doc:`tutorial chapter 4 <tutorial/part04/04_rates>`.
* Added in extra output to :class:`~metawards.Workspace` so that you can
  get the populations of all disease stages for all demographics. This
  is demonstrated in a rate calculation, also in the
  :doc:`new tutorial chapter 4 <tutorial/part04/04_rates>`.
* Fixed a directory permissions bug that appeared sometimes on windows.
* Fixed an existing bug from the C code whereby user-set values of
  contrib_foi are ignored. This had no impact as these values are always 1.0.
* Fixed a bug in distribute_remainders that meant that individuals could
  sometimes still be added to a demographic even if the desired percentage
  was zero.

`1.0.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/0.12.0...1.0.0>`__ - May 23rd 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Improved "go_to" and "go_isolate" functions, which now support modelling
  self-isolation and quarantine. This is all demonstrated in a new
  part 6 of the tutorial.
* Added an InteractionMatrix class to make it easier to create more
  sophisticated interaction matricies.
* Added ability for any plugin to signal that the model run should end
  after the current iteration by raising a StopIteration exception
* Added a "--model single" mode that uses a single-ward model for
  debugging and validation purposes.
* Updated parallel runners (multiprocessing, scoop and MPI) to return
  results as they are available, so that the Console can report summaries
  and live progress.
* Added a developer's "debug" mode to the Console, complete with nice
  variable printing.
* Lots of file and text encoding fixes, particularly to fix unicode
  issues on windows.
* Finally fixed the issue on windows where the wrong plugin would
  sometimes be loaded.
* Updated all tutorial outputs to the new format.
* Fixed a runtime check exception that occurred on rare occasions on Windows.
  This didn't cause any errors in data, but did stop runs from continuing
  when the run-time test was failed.


`0.12.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/0.11.2...0.12.0>`__ - May 18th 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Switched to configargparse to have better management of command line options,
  plus adding the ability to set options using a config file. This is now
  written to the output directory of each job to support reproducibility.
* metawards-plot defaults to png output if pillow (and jpeg) are not available
* Got basic movers working and added half of the sixth part of the tutorial,
  where self-isolation is modelled.
* Added rich-console support, which has significantly altered the look and
  feel of metawards. Output is now more robust, with more info given in
  real time for parallel jobs, plus all output now also being recorded
  to output/console.txt.bz2, so that no output is lost.
* Added theming support and a "simple" theme activated using "--theme simple"
  for those that don't like colour ;-)
* Added support for setting the number of repeats for a VariableSet into
  the output file. Also can specify different number of repeats for different
  adjustable variable sets on the command line.
* Cleaned up the design file and user custom variable file parsing to use
  csv and support a wide range of formats, variable types and inputs.
  Can now directly work with dates, ints, floats, bools and strings. This
  is intelligent, and will use the best type it thinks, but it can be
  forced by the user via a d"3.4" numpy-type syntax
* Improved the robustness of the parallel runners (multiprocessing, scoop
  and mpi4py) such that errors in one job don't break all jobs. These are
  now handled individually and recorded properly. Jobs are run async so
  that results are processed and feedback is given to the user as soon
  as it is available.
* Updated all of the tutorial to use lurgy3 - accidentally had gone back
  to lurgy2 in part 5.

`0.11.2 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/0.11.1...0.11.2>`__ - May 11th 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Minor bugfixes
* Use last matching custom function rather than first, so
  that the examples in the tutorial work and behaviour is more natural
* Caching network builds so that they are more thoroughly tested, fixed
  bug in networks.copy that meant that independent copies weren't made.
  This bug did not impact any past results or runs.
* Added more validation tests of the mixers
* Cleaned up website typos and fixed the version switcher
* Fixed packaging problems that caused broken builds when pip installing
  from a .tgz sdist package.

`0.11.1 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/0.11.0...0.11.1>`__ - May 10th 2020

* Fixed CI/CD to produce working sdist and bdist packages

`0.11.0 <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/compare/0.10.0...0.11.0>`__ - May 10th 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Code now fully works and has been tested on Windows :-)
* Major update of the API to support a Networks of multiple Network objects
* This has been used to support modelling multiple demographics
* Added in movers and mixers to enable a user to customise how individuals
  are moved between demographics and how the FOIs of demographics are
  merged together (e.g. via an interaction matrix). This is demonstrated
  in part 5 of the tutorial which shows how this can be used to model
  shielding
* Allow compilation using compilers that don't support OpenMP - now compiles
  even on stock OS X.
* Added more extractors and can now output files that are needed for graphics
* Added a special random number seed to support debugging
* Moved random number files to a separate library which is now properly
  compiled and linked.
* Updated CI to CI/CD and now build the OS X, Windows and ManyLinux wheels
* Updated URLs to metawards.org
* Allow multiple multi-node jobs to run from a single directory (they now
  have their own hostfiles)
* Updated metawards-plot to render multi-demographic trajectories and
  to make better animations.
* General bug fixes and speed-ups :-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fully working Python port of the original C code that completely reproduces
  the results of the C code when given the same random number seed. However,
  it is *significantly* slower! Python port has promise, so worth exploring
  different options for speeding the code up.

`Start of the Python port <https://github.com/metawards/MetaWards/commit/ef989ece450c40fe0ddb9f22e21693c90afb432e>`__ - March 25th 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Imported code from https://github.com/ldanon/metawards and began thinking
  about what the code was and trying to understand it. Decided to write
  a port as I find that if I can translate something, then I can
  understand it.
