Part 7 - Different pathways for different demographics
======================================================

In this seventh part of the tutorial you will;

* Learn how to give different disease pathways to different demographics.
* Explore how this can be used to model different disease behaviours
  and progress for different groups
* See how this can be combined with move functions to model conditional
  pathways, e.g. if individuals are sent to hospital
* See how you can name the different stages of the disease, e.g. to
  support collecting statistics such as the number of hospital patients
