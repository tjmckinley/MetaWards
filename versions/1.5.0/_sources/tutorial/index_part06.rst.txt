Part 6 - Moving between demographics
====================================

In this sixth part of the tutorial you will:

* Understand how you can move individuals between demographics using
  :doc:`metawards.movers <../api/index_MetaWards_movers>`.
* Use ``go functions`` to model the movement of individuals as they
  go into isolation and then are released back to their normal life
* Learn how to write custom movers to investigate when individuals
  should isolate, and how many days they should stay quarantined.
* Learn how to conditionally send a fraction of individuals to
  another demographic, so you can investigate different levels of
  compliance with self-isolation orders, and different compliance
  rates for quarantine
