Part 2 - Refining the model
===========================

In this second part of the tutorial you will:

* Learn how to change a disease model by adding in an extra "infectious
  but asymptomatic" stage to the lurgy.
* Learn how to perform parameter sweeps to investigate how disease
  parameters change the population trajectories during a *model run*.
* Understand random error by running a parameter sweep with many
  repeats.
* Learn how to run ``metawards`` on a HPC cluster
* Learn how to examine a hypothesis and conduct a large model run on a
  cluster to gather evidence.
* Learn how to change the underlying geographic model data
