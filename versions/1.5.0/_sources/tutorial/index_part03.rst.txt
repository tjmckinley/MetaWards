Part 3 - Customising the outbreak
=================================

In this third part of the tutorial you will:

* Understand the purpose of `metawards.iterators.iterate_default`
* Learn how to use different iterators on different days, so that
  the program can model weekends
* Create a custom iterator to represent a lockdown
* Learn how to trigger a custom iterator to start at a specific date
* Create an adjustable variable so that you can model lockdowns with
  different levels of effectiveness
* Setup models in which lockdowns are ended, and then explore what
  happens next
* Create models in which lockdowns can be stopped and started in
  response to changing conditions
