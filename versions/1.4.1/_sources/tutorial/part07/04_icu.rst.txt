=================
Modelling the ICU
=================

We have modelled the hospital as single patient population. However,
for a small proportion of cases, we need to model an extra stage
in the hospital for patients that need to go to the
intensive care unit (ICU).

We will use the ``H2`` state to model this. We will model that 10%
of patients in the ``H2`` state go to the ``H2`` state of an ``ICU``
demographic, while the remainder are immediately moved back home
to the ``R`` state, as they will have recovered from the disease.

To do this, modify your ``demographics.json`` file to read;

::

    {
        "demographics" : ["home", "staff", "patients", "icu"],
        "work_ratios"  : [ 0.99,   0.01,     0.00,     0.00 ],
        "play_ratios"  : [ 1.00,   0.00,     0.00,     0.00 ],
        "diseases"     : [ null,   null,   "lurgy_hospital", "lurgy_hospital" ]
    }

.. note::

   Now you can see the reason for the ``H2`` state - it is being used to
   model the ICU. Using two states like this enables us to use the
   same ``lurgy_hospital`` disease file to model the hospital.

Next, we need to modify the ``mix_hospital.py`` to read;

.. code-block:: python

    from metawards.mixers import merge_using_matrix

    def mix_shield(network, **kwargs):
        matrix = [ [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                   [0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1],
                   [0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0],
                   [0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0] ]

        network.demographics.interaction_matrix = matrix

        return [merge_using_matrix]

.. note::

  The only change here is adding in the fourth row and column for the ICU
  population. They don't contribute to the FOI of each other, other patients
  or home, but can infect and be infected by the hospital staff.

Next we need to modify ``extract_hospital.py`` to obtain the ICU
statistics. Edit the file and copy in the below;

.. code-block:: python

    from metawards.extractors import extract_default


    def output_patients(network, population, workspace, output_dir, **kwargs):
        # Open the file "patients.csv" in the output directory,
        # using the supplied headers for the columns
        FILE = output_dir.open("patients.csv",
                               headers=["day", "H1", "H2", "ICU"],
                               sep=",")

        # Now get the workspace for the "patients" demographic
        index = network.demographics.get_index("patients")
        subspace = workspace.subspaces[index]

        # The total population at each infection stage is the sum
        # of the work and play infections
        inf_tot = [inf + pinf for inf, pinf in
                   zip(subspace.inf_tot, subspace.pinf_tot)]

        H1 = inf_tot[2]
        H2 = inf_tot[3]

        # Now get the ICU demographic
        index = network.demographics.get_index("icu")
        subspace = workspace.subspaces[index]

        inf_tot = [inf + pinf for inf, pinf in
                   zip(subspace.inf_tot, subspace.pinf_tot)]

        ICU = inf_tot[3]

        FILE.write(str(population.day) + ",")
        FILE.write(",".join([str(x) for x in [H1, H2, ICU]]) + "\n")


    def extract_patients(**kwargs):
        # return all of the functions from "extract_default"
        # plus our new "output_i1"
        funcs = extract_default(**kwargs)
        funcs.append(output_patients)
        return funcs

.. note::

   The change here is that we extract only ``H1`` and ``H2`` from the
   ``patients`` demographic, before getting what we will call ``ICU``
   from the ``icu`` demographic.

Multiple go functions go home
-----------------------------

Finally, we will now update the ``move_hospital.py`` file so that
we will have four "go functions":

* First we start with the function that moves 20% of the ```home``
  and ``staff`` ``I2`` population to ``H1`` patients.

* Next, we move 10% of the ``H2`` ``patients`` to the same stage
  in the ``icu`` demographic. We will refer to this as ``ICU``.

* Next, we move the remainder of ``H2`` ``patients`` to ``R`` in ``home``,
  as these patients have now fully recovered and can go home.

* Finally, we move all ``R`` ``patients`` and ``icu`` members to ``R``
  in ``home`` as they have fully recovered and can go home.

You can implement this by editing your ``move_hospital.py`` file and
copying in the below;

.. code-block:: python

    from metawards.movers import go_stage


    def move_hospital(**kwargs):
        # move 20% of I2 home/staff population to H1 patients
        func1 = lambda **kwargs: go_stage(go_from=["home", "staff"],
                                          go_to="patients",
                                          from_stage=4,
                                          to_stage=2,
                                          fraction=0.2,
                                          **kwargs)

        # move 10% of H2 patients to H2 ICU
        func2 = lambda **kwargs: go_stage(go_from="patients",
                                          go_to="icu",
                                          from_stage=3,
                                          to_stage=3,
                                          fraction=0.1,
                                          **kwargs)

        # move the remainder of H2 patients to home R
        func3 = lambda **kwargs: go_stage(go_from="patients",
                                          go_to="home",
                                          from_stage=3,
                                          to_stage=-1,
                                          fraction=1.0,
                                          **kwargs)

        # move R ICU and patients to home R
        func4 = lambda **kwargs: go_stage(go_from=["patients", "icu"],
                                          go_to="home",
                                          from_stage=-1,
                                          to_stage=-1,
                                          fraction=1.0,
                                          **kwargs)

        return [func1, func2, func3, func4]

You can then run ``metawards`` using the command;

.. code-block:: bash

   metawards -D demographics.json -d lurgy4 --mixer mix_hospital --mover move_hospital --extract extract_hospital -a ExtraSeedsLondon.dat

You should see patients arriving in hospital, with some moving to the ICU.
By the end of the outbreak everyone has recovered and has returned home.

You can plot the demographics trajectory using;

.. code-block:: bash

   metawards-plot -i output/trajectory.csv.bz2

You should see a plot similar to this;

.. image:: ../../images/tutorial_7_4_1.jpg
   :alt: Demographic trajectories for the simple hospital plus ICU model

The ICU population is just visible on this plot, and is seen to lag behind
the patient population. You can see this more clearly by plotting the data
that was output to the ``output/patients.csv.bz2`` file, e.g. using
pandas;

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pandas as pd
   >>> df = pd.read_csv("output/patients.csv.bz2")
   >>> df.plot(x="day")
   >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   >>> plt.savefig("hospital.jpg")

You should see output something similar to this;

.. image:: ../../images/tutorial_7_4_2.jpg
   :alt: Populations of the H1, H2 and ICU states

Similarly, we can extract the peak patient and ICU populations, via;

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> df = pd.read_csv("output/patients.csv.bz2")
    >>> df[ df["H1"] == df["H1"].max() ]
         day       H1      H2     ICU
    127  127  1890553  472957  172004
    >>> df[ df["ICU"] == df["ICU"].max() ]
         day       H1      H2     ICU
    132  132  1779346  445783  180845

This again shows that the time around 130 days since the start of the
outbreak would be most challenging, with a peak of nearly 1.9 million
normal patients, and over 180 thousand ICU patients.

Note that this is a very simplified model and data fitting would be
needed to optimise the various parameters (e.g. the interaction matrix
or the percentages of population who move from, e.g. ``H2`` to ``ICU``).
Also this is missing lots of other movements.

However, we hope that this gives you a good idea of how you can use
demographics, mixing functions / interaction matrices, plus
move functions to conditionally move to different disease stages in
different demographics, to model a wide range of different scenarios.
